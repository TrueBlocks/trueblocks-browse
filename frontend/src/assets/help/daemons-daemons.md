#### daemons-daemons.md

The Daemons view displays a list of background processes that run periodically to freshen the data, including pushing data to IPFS, querying your node to keep the data fresh, and scraping the Unchained Index.

The display shows the daemon's name, its IP address, its current status, and the timestamp of the last time the daemon ran.

Click edit to modify a given daemon's configuration.
