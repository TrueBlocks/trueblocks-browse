### Servers View

The Servers view displays a list of servers that are currently being monitored. The list includes the server name, the server's IP address, the server's status, and the server's last check-in time. The list can be sorted by any of these columns by clicking on the column header. The list can also be filtered by entering text in the filter box at the top of the list.
