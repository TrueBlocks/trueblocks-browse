The Unchained Index Indexes view displays a list of all index portions in your local database.

The list includes the index name, the collection name, the keys, and the options. The view also provides the ability to create a new index, drop an existing index, and view the index details.

#### Sharing

When you pin these index portions on your IPFS gateway, the pin CID will be recorded in your manifest which you may then later publish to the Unchained Index smart contact. This will allow others to share in the use of this data (allowing them to avoid building the index themselves, for example).
