The wizard RPC page checks your configuration's RPC endpoint.

If the RPC is not configured, you will be asked for a valid RPC endpoint. This may be any valid EVM RPC, but we strongly suggest that you run your own node. The speed difference is quite significant. If you cannot get your own node, the next best solution is a dedicated RPC service such as BlockJoy or Infura's for-pay service.

It is possible to use a publically available free RPC, but these are often slow and unreliable. If you are using a publically available free RPC, you may need to increase the timeout settings to avoid false positives.
