The Wizard view runs the first time you ever use the application or whenever there's an error that needs correction. (You may also open the Wizard view by pressing Command+W.)

The wizard is "page based" which means that you may not proceed to a new page until the issues (if any) on the current page are resolved. (If there are no additional issues, you may skip to the finish page.)
